    <description>I was inspired by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3457323483]What If Isaac Wasn't Isaac?[/url] and decided to implement Minesweeper in Isaac.

There's technically a Minesweeper in Hyperbirth mod on the workshop, so I thought I'd try something different and implement this with ImGui provided by Repentogon.

Press the tilde key to open the new debug console and menu. There's a new Shenanigans option that will let you play Minesweeper. The goal is to uncover all the squares without a bomb.

There's no right-click support here so you'll need to choose the mouse (uncover) option or the flag (add/remove) option before clicking. There's also a checkered flag option that acts as a hybrid solution: click to add a flag, double-click to uncover the flagged square. You can hold one of the triggers on a plugged-in controller to temporarily use flag mode. Unfortunately, keyboard modifiers don't work here. The board's first click will never set a flag and is always safe.

The 3 buttons at the top-left of the board are: restart, view all (also ends the board), hint (uncovers a random square if you're stuck).

There's options to:
[list]
    [*]change how the first click works: safe, safe + empty
    [*]change the color preset: off, dark, light (can be used with tools-&gt;style editor-&gt;colors)
    [*]change the size of the squares: small, med, large
    [*]enable the prize system: hearts, coins, keys, bombs, batteries, pills, cards, trinkets, grab bags, or treasure room items (only in intermediate/expert)
    [*]change bomb counts: 1 to 75% max density
